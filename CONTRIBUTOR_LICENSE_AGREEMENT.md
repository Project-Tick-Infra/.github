PROJECT TICK CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT
Version 2, 2 February 2026

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") applies to all
contributions submitted to projects maintained within the Project Tick
ecosystem, regardless of the contributor's country of residence or
place of submission.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Definitions.

"Contribution" means any code, documentation, design, data, or other
material intentionally submitted by you to a Project Tick project for
inclusion in a Work.

"Work" means the Project Tick project to which the Contribution is
submitted.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Authority and Right to Contribute.

You represent and confirm that:
(a) you have the legal right and authority to submit the Contribution;
(b) the Contribution is your original work, or you have obtained all
    necessary rights, permissions, or licenses to submit it under this
    Agreement; and
(c) to the best of your knowledge, the Contribution does not infringe
    any copyright, patent, trademark, or other proprietary right of
    any third party.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Grant of Copyright License.

You hereby grant Project Tick and all downstream recipients a
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, and irrevocable
copyright license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish,
distribute, sublicense, and convey your Contribution as part of the
Work, under the terms of the applicable Project Tick license.

This license grant applies to all current and future forms of
distribution of the Work permitted by the applicable license.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. License Consistency and Relicensing.

You acknowledge that Project Tick maintains a family of licenses and
that Contributions are integrated for long-term governance.

Accordingly, you agree that your Contribution may be distributed under
the applicable Project Tick license governing the Work, including
future versions of that license or other Project Tick licenses where
explicitly permitted by their terms.

Once your Contribution has been accepted into a Work, you waive any
right, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, to revoke,
withdraw, or relicense the Contribution independently of the Work,
except as expressly allowed by the applicable Project Tick license.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. No Warranty and No Obligation.

You provide the Contribution "AS IS", without warranty of any kind,
whether express or implied.

You are not required to provide support, maintenance, updates, or
ongoing services for the Contribution.

Project Tick is under no obligation to accept, use, maintain, or
distribute any Contribution.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. No Additional Restrictions.

You agree not to impose any legal, contractual, technical, or policy-
based restrictions on the use of your Contribution that would conflict
with this Agreement or with the applicable Project Tick license.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Governing Law and Interpretation.

This Agreement is intended to be applied globally. It shall be
interpreted in a manner that gives maximum effect to the permissions
and intentions expressed herein, consistent with applicable local law.

If any provision of this Agreement is held unenforceable under
applicable law, such provision shall be interpreted or limited only to
the extent necessary to render it enforceable, without affecting the
validity of the remaining provisions.
